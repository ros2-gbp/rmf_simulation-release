ros-foxy-rmf-robot-sim-gazebo-plugins (1.0.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Provides the readonly Gazebo plugin that emulates the behavior of a read_only fleet type. When attached to a steerable vehicle that operates on a known traffic graph, the plugin publishes a prediction of the vehicle's intended path to the rmf traffic database via its configured read_only_fleet_adapter. Other fleets operating in the space can plan routes to avoid the path of this vehicle.
  * Provides TeleportDispenser Gazebo plugin that is attached to the TeleportDispenser model in rmf_demo_assets. When loaded into Gazebo along side a "payload" model, the plugin will teleport the payload onto the nearest robot when it registers a rmf_dispenser_msgs::DispenserRequest message with target_guid matching its model name.
  * Provides TeleportIngestor Gazebo plugin that is attached to the TeleportIngestor model in rmf_demo_assets. When loaded into Gazebo, the plugin will teleport the payload off the nearest robot and onto its location, when it registers a rmf_dispenser_msgs::DispenserRequest message with target_guid matching its model name.
